# To-do

Everything I (think) I need to launch this version of Masilotti.com.

* `<title>` and `<description>` for every page
* `og:image` for every page
* Wire up the newsletter component to POST to Buttondown
  * Footer
  * /hotwire
  * inline
* Port over each article, including images and updating internal links
* Port over each newsletter edition, including updating internal links
* Remove sponsor includes
* Update "railsdevs" to "RailsDevs"
* Redirect `/topics` to `/archive`
* Link to `/turbo-ios` at top of `/articles`
* Sitemap

## Nice-to-haves

New features/pages I'd love to see included.

* A services or "hire me" page highlighting what I can help folks with
* Update the Turbo Native workshop page to collect only email
* Redirect `/turbo-ios` to `turbo-native`
* Extract input fields to ensure same style (maybe small vs. base?)

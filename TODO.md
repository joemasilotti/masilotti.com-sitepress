# To-do

Everything (I think) I need to launch this version of Masilotti.com.

* Port over each article, including images and updating internal links
* Port over each newsletter edition, including updating internal links
* Remove sponsor includes
* Update "railsdevs" to "RailsDevs"
* Sitemap
* 404 page

## Nice-to-haves

New features/pages I'd love to see included.

* Redirect `/turbo-ios` to `turbo-native`
* Success page for Buttondown email confirmation

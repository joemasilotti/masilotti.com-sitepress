          I’ve loved making things for as long as I can remember, and
          wrote my first program when I was 6 years old, just two weeks
          after my mom brought home the brand new Macintosh LC 550 that I
          taught myself to type on.
        </p>

        <p>
          The only thing I loved more than computers as a kid was space.
          When I was 8, I climbed the 40-foot oak tree at the back of our
          yard while wearing my older sister’s motorcycle helmet, counted
          down from three, and jumped — hoping the tree was tall enough
          that with just a bit of momentum I’d be able to get to orbit.
        </p>

        <p>
          I spent the next few summers indoors working on a rocket design,
          while I recovered from the multiple surgeries it took to fix my
          badly broken legs. It took nine iterations, but when I was 15 I
          sent my dad’s Blackberry into orbit and was able to transmit a
          photo back down to our family computer from space.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, I’m the founder of Planetaria, where we’re working on
          civilian space suits and manned shuttle kits you can assemble at
          home so that the next generation of kids really <em>can</em>
          make it to orbit — from the comfort of their own backyards.
